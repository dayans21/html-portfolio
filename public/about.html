<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Dayana Soria.I’ve always had a passion for building and organizing, which naturally led me to front-end development 
  and project management. I attended the Baccalaureate School for Global Education in New York, where my love for problem-solving 
  and technology took root.Now, as a student at Cornell University, set to graduate in 2025, I’ve sharpened my skills in designing 
  user-friendly interfaces and leading projects from ideation to execution. Whether it’s coding an interactive website or streamlining
  workflows for a team, I enjoy the process of bringing ideas to life in a way that feels seamless and engaging.</p>

<p>Growing up in New York City, I was surrounded by a mix of cultures, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. 
  As an Ecuadorian and a proud Latina in STEM, I know firsthand how important representation is in tech, and 
  I strive to carve out space for people like me. I’m also the youngest of three, which means I grew up watching 
  and learning from my older siblings while adding my own twist to things. And, of course, I can't forget 
  about my two lovely dogs—they bring so much joy and chaos into my life, and I wouldn't change it for the world.</p>

<p>Outside of work and school, I love anything that lets me express myself. Singing and acting have always been 
  passions of mine, and performing gives me a sense of excitement and creativity that I carry into all aspects of my life. 
  Lately, I’ve also developed a deep love for reading, especially fantasy books. There’s something magical about getting 
  lost in different worlds and exploring stories filled with adventure, imagination, and the occasional dragon. 
  Whether on stage, behind a screen, or lost in a novel, I love finding ways to bring stories to life.</p>
