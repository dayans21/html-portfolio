<h3>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</h3>
<p>I love the visuals and the plot, Katniss is a badass.</p>
<h3>Miracle in Cell Number 7</h3>
<p>A Turkish movie but by far one of my favorites. It brought me to tears.</p>
<h3>Arthur The King</h3>
<p>This movie also made me cry, the Ecuadorian stray dog that fought for a home.</p>
